# epoll-rs

The main purpose of this library is to implement a very lightweight (i.e. 
minimal abstractions) and safe library for epoll. There are existing
crates that support epoll including, but not limited to [epoll](https://github.com/nathansizemore/epoll) and [mio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio). I am writing this library
as a project to learn Rust and [libc](https://github.com/rust-lang/libc).
